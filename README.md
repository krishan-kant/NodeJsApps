# Weather App: 
The app uses the concept of fetching json data from api which is now divided in server side and client side scripts. 
The /src/app.js is the server side application running with express module and weather can be requested here with search querry.
    The second script file in public/js/app.js is the client side script and it requests the data from api via the first script. The output is then rendered into the home page.
    Static pages were removed and dynamic pages are now added.
