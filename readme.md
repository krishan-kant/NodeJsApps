Learning NodeJs by making apps.

1. Notes App: The app runs in terminal only. Arguments are parsed with Yarg and colour coding of output is done with chalk. With --help as argument all the commands will be shown in the terminal with proper description.

2. Weather App: Fetches weather info with city name as argument while running app.js, express framework to be used soon.
